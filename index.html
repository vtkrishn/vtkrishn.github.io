            <p>Don't rembember when I started coding but got fascinated with computers when I was in freshman years. After getting my new computer I spend lot of time playing online games. Some where down the line I started exploring some of the best things that can be done with it which pushed me to learn programming.
            I got my hands dirty coding with C and C++ at the early stage and managed to complete my formal gradute degree with some handful of hobby projects.</p>
            <p>My passion towards computers made to pursue a career as a <b>Software Engineer.</b></p>
